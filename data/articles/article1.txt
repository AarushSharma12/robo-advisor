Tariffs on Canadian imports, especially energy, are a􀆯ecting companies like Enbridge (ENB) and Suncor
Energy, which supply oil and gas to U.S. refiners and face pricing pressures. U.S. firms relying on
Canadian pulp and lumber, such as International Paper (IP), are seeing cost increases. Cross-border
manufacturing firms like Caterpillar (CAT) and General Electric (GE) are exposed to supply chain disruptions.
The Ukraine conflict has had targeted impacts. PepsiCo (PEP) and Philip Morris International (PM) saw revenue
declines due to their exposure to Russia and Ukraine. EPAM Systems (EPAM), with a large workforce in
Eastern Europe, faced operational disruptions. McDonald's (MCD) and Carnival Corp. (CCL) experienced
revenue hits from closures and reduced travel.

Despite strategic cooperation, tariff tensions persist with India. Companies like Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) are
negotiating local manufacturing to bypass tariffs. U.S. firms importing APIs from India, such as
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), face rising costs. Deals involving General Electric (GE) for jet engines are part of
tariff-for-technology exchanges.

The Fed’s recent rate cuts have had mixed effects. Regional banks such as PNC Financial (PNC) and Fifth
Third Bancorp have rebounded due to relief in bond portfolio losses. Lower rates benefit Equity
Residential and Prologis (PLD), especially in residential and industrial REITs. Defensive stocks like Procter
& Gamble and Coca-Cola (KO) tend to perform well post-rate cuts. Companies like D.R. Horton (DHI) and
Lennar (LEN) have surged on expectations of revived housing demand.

The conflict in the Middle East has heightened risks in energy and defense sectors. Brent crude
spiked due to fears of supply disruptions. Companies like Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB) may
benefit from price volatility. Firms such as Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) are poised
for increased demand amid rising geopolitical tensions. Shipping and logistics firms face higher
costs due to Red Sea disruptions.

Tariffs have emerged as a central tool in U.S. trade policy, affecting multiple sectors. Freight and
logistics firms like FedEx (FDX) and Union Pacific (UNP) face reduced volumes and rising costs due to tariffs on
imported machinery and raw materials. Companies like Nike (NKE) and Ralph Lauren (RL) are hit by higher
costs on imported apparel and footwear, leading to margin pressure. Firms such as Salesforce (CRM) and
Meta Platforms (META) have responded with conservative dividend increases due to supply chain
disruptions. Tariffs on pharmaceutical ingredients from China and India are raising costs for
companies like Pfizer (PFE) and AbbVie (ABBV), potentially slowing R&D. Although oil and gas are exempt,
companies like ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are affected indirectly through reduced global demand
and falling crude prices.
